# CAPM-Regression
CAPM regression is a statistical analysis technique used to estimate the expected return on an individual asset or security based on the principles of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).

The CAPM regression estimates the expected return of an asset by regressing its historical returns against the returns of a market index, typically represented by a broad-based market index such as the S&P 500. The regression equation helps determine the asset's beta coefficient, which measures its sensitivity to market movements.
